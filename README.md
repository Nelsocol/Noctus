# Noctus

## Introduction

Noctus is a micro game engine and game player made for creating small but powerful text-based games. 
I created it to teach myself about the Lua scripting language by actually building a project that utilizes it. 
Noctus games are text based adventures, but their secret is the ability to integrate Lua scripting directly into the text based adventure to add complex and custom behaviors.

## Installation & Usage Instructions

The Noctus editor is a Windows Forms application, and the Noctus player is a Windows console application. To run either, clone the project, open them in Visual Studio, and run the application.
To run a game with the Noctus player, create a build, and then right click a .noctus file made in the Noctus Editor and tell it to open with the Noctus Player exe.

## Current Features

- Using the noctus editor, users can design simple text based adventures, integrating powerful lua syntax into their writing and behind the scenes.
- Using the noctus player, users can launch Noctus games and play through them, executing the Lua code in the game in real time and evaluating the results.

## Future Updates

I consider this project to be complete, as it was always intended to be a small side project built over a short period of time. 
My first priority if I were to ever return to it would be to build a more attractive UI for the Editor in a framework like Blazor, as well as a more attractive display than the console for the Player.
